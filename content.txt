1. class and obj (example)
2. class has attribute and func/methods.
    > Code walkthrough
    > attributes get called itself, methods are called manually
3. why python is called OOP ?
    > In python, everything including data structure, data types all are belongs from class developed by devs.
    > Thats why python called as OOPS. Everything in python is an Object.
4. Advantages of OOPS:
    > You can create your own datatype
    > code reusability
    > debugging
    > easy to colab

5. End to end project (chatbook class)
    > function vs method
    > magic method or dunder method
    > self
    > You can create attribute outside class as well

    > encapsulation
    > getter and setter
    > static method

6. Inheritance
    > Inheritance code example
    > Why inheritance is needed? (code, reuseability, parent has no access to child class)
    > what gets inherited? - Constructor, Non private attributes (without encapsulation sttributes), Non private methods (without encapsulation methods)
    > constructor overloading and method overloading
    > Super keyword(Can be used only inside class, can not acces variables/attribute, by the help of super(), we accessed only constructor which contain attribute, used only inside child class)
    
    > Types of inheritance - 1. Single Inheritance | 2. Multilevel | 3. Hierarchical | 4. Multiple <Diamond Problem> | 5. Hybrid
