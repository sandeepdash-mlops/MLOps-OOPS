# In python, everything including data structure, data types all are belongs from class developed by devs.
# Thats why python called as OOPS. Everything in python is an Object.

# a = 'x'
# b = 'y'
# print(a+b)
# o/p- xy
# its bcos in python doesn't have algebra till now didn't create
# you can create such datatype (Algebra) by the help oops concept you can use such magic methods, to get an o/p for algebra in this format. O/p (x+y)


# This is called modular coding.
